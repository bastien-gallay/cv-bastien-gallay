# Urgency scoring (for WSJF algorithm)

# Age scoring (for WSJF algorithm)
# Reduced weight to prevent old low-priority tasks from outranking recent high-priority ones
age_scoring:
  divisor: 20       # 1 point per N days (was 10, now 20 = half weight)
  max_score: 2.5    # Cap at this value (was 5, now 2.5 = half weight)
